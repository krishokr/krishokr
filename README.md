### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kris! I am a Frontend Developer who enjoys all things React. Three things you should know about me are that I love what I do, am a dedicated team member, and love to learn new tech. While I am fluent in frontend development, I believe an exceptional developer should be able to pivot and understand the intricacies of the entire application - in an effort to achieve this goal, I'm currently navigating Next 14 and learning to leverage the performance benefits of Server components, diving into building APIs with Prisma and SQL, and generally improving my skills in full stack development. 

Feel free to get in touch, would be happy to hear from you!
