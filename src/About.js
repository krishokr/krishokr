            <h3>My name is Kris Hokr, and I am currently in pursuit of a rewarding career as a Web Developer.</h3>
            <p>My journey to web development began during my final years in college when my friend was taking a computer science course. I excelled at my logic courses and found this type of thinking- of turning thoughts and ideas into a type of functional "code" - intriguing. While it was late to switch my major from Philosophy, I decided to minor in Computer Science, where I was introduced to more Python, Java, Data Structures and Algorithms, Databases, and eventually, Web Development. My Web Development course was my favorite computer science course by far, and while I felt like I learned a lot from my professor, I decided to jump into a coding bootcamp after college to polish my skills. At Career Foundry, I continued to learn more about not only vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript, but also delve deeper into React, Bootstrap, jQuery, Node.js, and MongoDB. I learned how all these technologies fit together to power the web, but more importantly, the importance of web development to marketing for businesses. </p>
            <p>As former President of UC Davis Climbing Team, I value camaraderie and teamwork. Others make work not only more meaningful, but more enjoyable. I believe group connection and passion lead to creative thinking, which allows you to find the answers and overcome adversity to produce a fresh and exciting product. From climbing, I have realized that pushing the boundary of what is possible is both thrilling and rewarding- even if you don't succeed, there's always something to gain from mistakes. Ultimately, there is always a solution, especially with a team of motivated individuals.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me climbing, running, and spending time in the mountains.</p>
